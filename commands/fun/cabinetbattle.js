			`ðŸŽµYou must be out of your GODDAMNED mind
If you think
The president is gonna bring the nation to the brink
Of meddling in the middle of a military mess
A game of chess
Where France is queen and king-less
We've signed a treaty with a king
Who's head is now in a basket
Would you like to take it out and ask it?
"Oh should we honor our treaty King Louis head?"
"Uh do whatever you want, I'm super dead!"ðŸŽµ`);
